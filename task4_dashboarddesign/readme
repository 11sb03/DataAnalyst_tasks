Using Power BI and Power Query, I pulled data from 6 different sources (including Azure Cloud) and created a relational database model and a Microsoft Power BI report to monitor sales performance across the organisation. The 4-page report is interactive and filterable, and uses historical data from 2010-2023 sales to track relevant KPIs and forecast their performance in the near future.
